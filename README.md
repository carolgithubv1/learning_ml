As the binary tree has more levels of nodes, the position of the root node labeled as d will be higher. The following data shows how the value of (a,b) stored in each node is updated or pruned off based on the inputs via the minimax algorithm. </p>

As the value of the binary tree was initialized as random numbers, based on the comparison between a and b, the binary tree might be pruned. Consequently, the binary tree has less number of nodes left to contain values. </p>

Through the following examples of the input values, more nodes can be saved rather than pruning off and their values update are observed. </p>

The following initial value of (a,b) stored i
